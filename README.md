# RNSail - React Native Starter

My starter kit for react native projects.  This is the implementation of using of [React Native Material UI](https://github.com/xotahal/react-native-material-ui) with [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation).

It's also included react-redux and screen tracking implementation as in React navigation suggested.

## Installation

### Create your local copy

To create new project using this, you need to copy/clone this to your local.

### Rename your Project

Then use [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) to rename the project from it's default RNStarter

    $ react-native-rename MyApp -b com.domain.myapp


### Install using yarn

After rename, you have to install first. This project created using yarn.

    $ yarn

### pod install for IOS

For IOS development, it's also need to install the pods (cocoapods), before it's can be run.

    $ cd ios
    $ pod install
    $ cd ..

### run 

Now 

    $ react-native run-ios 
or

    $ react-native run-android
